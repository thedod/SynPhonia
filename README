SynPhonia v0.2

Note: samples are no longer part of the repository. See below how to get them

What you need
 * Python >= 2.6
 * EyeD3 python library: http://eyed3.nicfit.net/
 * Sox and lame
 * Ability to run cgi (note: there's a .htaccess file here)

How to install
 1) Create synconf.py (See comment about it at synphonia.py).

 2) Get and unpack the samples:
    $ wget http://zzzen.com/synphonia.vadim.tar.bz2
    $ tar xjvf synphonia.vadim.tar.bz2

 3) Generate sample mp3s by doing
    $ for f in wav-samples/*.wav ; do lame $f samples/$(basename $f wav)mp3 ; done

 4) From python, do:
    >>> import synphonia
    >>> synphonia.init_samples()
    This will ID3 tag the mp3 files and create xspf files for them

How to use your own samples:
 * delete old-sample related stuff
   $ rm mixes/*.mp3 mixes/*.xspf wav-mixes/*.wav samples/*.wav samples/*.xspf wav-samples/*.wav

 * Put you samples at wav-samples. Name them as a single letter, repeated to
   indicate length in bars (e.g. 1 bar: x.wav, 4 bars: zzzz.wav)

 * Make sure you have a 1-bar-long sample of silence called_.wav

 * You may also change definitions at synphonia.py (e.g. ARTIST and ALBUM
   used for ID3 tagging, cache sizes, etc.)

 * Repeat steps 3 and 4 above
