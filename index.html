    <h3>SynPhonia - a cellular friendly web-based musical toy</h3>

    <p>To start playing music right away, <b>just go <a href=
    "synphonia.py?c0=_yjjrrsszz&amp;c1=__llllkk_y&amp;c2=__gggghh__&amp;c3=addcbbacdd&amp;s=-1">
    here</a>.</b><br />
    <b>Musician:</b> Want to have such a toy with your own sounds?
    See <a target="_blank" href=
    "http://wiki.github.com/thedod/SynPhonia/">here</a> how.<br />

    <p><b>Instructions</b><br />
    Each field in the form represents a track in the mix. You can
    fill it with names of sounds you see below. The length of a
    sound's name represents its duration (e.g. <i>bb</i> takes
    twice longer to play than <i>a</i>). In other words: each
    letter represents a musicar bar.<br />
    The special sound <i>_</i> represents silence.<br />
    The <i>AutoPlay</i> checkbox can save you the extra click on
    the mix's player button (a matter of personal taste).</p>

    <p>If you want to hear how a track sounds by itself, you can
    select the <i>Solo</i> radio button to the right of it, and
    remix. To go back to the full mix, click on <i>No solo</i>.</p>

    <p>Once you have a mix you're proud of, you can use the
    _Share/Submit_ link in order to share your mix in social and/or
    submit your mix to us. You'll also see a short url for your
    mix. You can copy/paste it into mail, chat, etc.</p>

    <p><img width="240" align="left" hspace="8" src=
    "phone-shot.jpg" alt="SynPhonia on a phone. Yah." /> You can
    also try <b>j.mp/synpho</b> from your phone. The only
    difference is that on not-so-smart-phones (like the one in the
    picture) you won't see the cute little player buttons (this
    also means the <i>AutoPlay</i> checkbox won't do anything), but
    you can still click on the links to the mix and the samples,
    and if your phone can play mp3, you can party.</p>

    <p>Enjoy,<br />
